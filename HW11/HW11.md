### Evaluate the effects of the variants in your VCF file. If, for some reason, you can't make any of the variant effect prediction softwware work, you may use visual inspection via IGV to describe the effect of variants.

I think I was able to correctly use VEP to evaluate the effects of my variants in the VCF file. I have loaded the html VEP file into my github repository. 

### Find variants with different effects.
VEP found 48442 variants, most of which were categorized as SNPs. 36 were INS and 32 were DEL.

Upstream and downstream effects combined accounted for over 80% of the effects. 

This is the codon changes table:

The most frequent change was changing ATC to ATT.
