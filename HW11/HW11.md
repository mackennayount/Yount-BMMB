# Homework 11

### Evaluate the effects of the variants in your VCF file. If, for some reason, you can't make any of the variant effect prediction softwware work, you may use visual inspection via IGV to describe the effect of variants.

I was unable to use both the VEP and snpEff tools to find variants. VEP did not have my organism, L. monocytogenes, as a reference and I was unable to download the tool to use in my command line. I tried to run the snpEff with the toolbox and build the custom database but I kept getting the following error message:
```bash
java.lang.RuntimeException: FATAL ERROR: Offending line (lineNum: 11): 'origin of replication during the initiation of chromosomal replication%3B can also affect transcription of multiple genes including itself.;experiment=EXISTENCE:[PMID:19448609];gbkey=CDS;gene=dnaA;locus_tag=lmo0001;product=chromosome replication initiator DnaA;protein_id=NP_463534.1;transl_table=11'. File '/Users/mpy5101/Yount-BMMB/week11/snpEff/idx/snpEff/genome/genes.gff' line 11
```
and also a bunch of other error messages that I couldn't quite make sense of.

Using the other target for VEP in my make file, I tried to run it and I got this error many times over and over:
```bash
[E::get_intv] Failed to parse TBX_GENERIC, was wrong -p [type] used?
The offending line was: "NC_003210.1"
```

### Find variants with different effects.
Because of the issues I was having with the two tools, I decided to manually inspect with IGV to find different variant effects. 

I tried to go into IGV and manually inspect but no matter what GFF file I used to look at the coding sequences for comparisons, I got this error:

I'm not really sure what parts of my process were going wrong because I tried to make the variables for my targets in my own makefile match the variables and targets for the provided code on the class website and I tried running it all from scratch in a fresh directory/environment but with no luck.

Sorry for a dud of a homework this week :( if you have any advice to fix my issues that would be greatly appreciated
