*Mackenna Yount*

Write a Script that downloads data from the SRA or ENA database and performs a quality control analysis on the data.

Identify a bad sequencing dataset
Data: SRR954536
Publication: PRJNA215355

1. Write a script to download data from the SRA database

see hw06.sh in github repository 

2. Evaluate the quality of the downloaded data
3. Improve the quality of the reads in the dataset

4. Evaluate the quality again and document the improvements

I struggled to find a bad sequencing dataset, this one was from 2014 so I thought there would be a chance that it would be bad but it wasn't really too bad. This data did come from the FDA though so I guess that is a good sign that it isn't bad. 

The untrimmed data had per sequence GC content, sequence length distribution, and overrepresented sequences flagged and per base sequence content was listed with an X.

After trimming, the only flagged summary was sequence length distribution and per base sequence content was still listed with an X. 

Trimming the data did remove the sequences of N's, which had a count of 54.
