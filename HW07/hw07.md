The following describes how the makefile for this assignment works and what each target does.

Each bullet under variables details what the variable input is.

Each bullet under targets describes each step within a target.

### HW5 Variables
* REFSEQ: the reference sequence info for a GCF file
* FASTA_FILE: FASTA file from the initial download
* FASTA: renamed FASTA file for easier file navigation
* Nsim, Lsim, R1sim, and R2sim: for the simulated reads, N=number of reads, L=length of reads, R1 and R2 are reads 1 and 2
* GENOME: location of the simulated genome

### HW5 Targets
**refseq**

Download reference sequence
* downloads the GFF file from NCBI
* unzips the NCBI file
* link file to a simpler name
* list files and summary of files

**simulate**

Simulate Illumina reads
* list the first 10 lines of the FASTA file
* count the number of chromosomes 
* count the number of bases in the chromosome
* makes a directory to store reads
* simulate paired end reads
* run read statistics
* calculate the size of the read files
* compress the read files
* calculate the size of the compressed read files

### HW6 Variables
* SRR: SRR number 
* N, R1, R2, T1, T2: N=number of reads, R1/R2= reads 1 and 2, T1/T2=trimmed reads 1 and two
* RDIR: reads directory
* PDIR: reports directory

### HW6 Targets
**download**

download SRR number
* make directories for reads and reports
* download the FASTQ file
* run fastqc

**trim**

trim the sequence
* run fastp and trim for quality
* run fastqc on the trimmed files

**clean**
* remove the zipped NCBI datasets
