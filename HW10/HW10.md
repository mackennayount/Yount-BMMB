# HW10 - Variant Calling
*Mackenna Yount*

This assignment reuses the Makefile to generate a BAM file from SRA reads.

### Call variants on the BAM file and discuss some information on the variants you found.

There were a lot of variants I think because the BAM did not have a lot of coverage. Within a 642bp region, there were 24 variations. I am not sure if there will be more variants or not if there is more coverage in the BAM file. 

### Verify the variant caller's results by looking at the alignments in the BAM file.
This is the BAM file zoomed out, you can tell that there is not a lot of coverage here.

This is the BAM file zoomed in to about 600bp.

This is the VCF file compared to the BAM. All the variants match up between the BAM and the VCF.

### Find examples where the variant caller did not work as expected: false positives, false negatives, etc.
Here is a place where my VCF file didn't match up. My cursor is right under the spot.
